I enjoy figuring things out. New tools, techniques, frameworks, APIs, workarounds — if something sparks my interest, I want to understand how it works. Not necessarily to do something useful with it right away, but simply because I want to know.

Up until now, I mostly shared those discoveries with colleagues or friends. But I started to notice more and more:

Not because I have all the answers — far from it. But writing things down helps me organize my thoughts. And who knows, maybe someone else will find it useful too. Maybe you, reading this right now. Maybe future me, when I’ve long forgotten how something worked.

This site is my digital notebook - a place to experiment, learn, and occasionally publish something, just because it makes me happy.

> If I’m already figuring things out, why not share them?

That’s it for now. I hope you enjoy reading as much as I enjoyed figuring things out.
